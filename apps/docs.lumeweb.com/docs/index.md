This project was created so that we can have a *true* open web in which we can start back from web 1.0 and build what should have been, but never happened. While this idea as a whole takes on many names, we can all agree that it should be about openness and freedom.

We are doing `progressive decentralization`. This means that at this time, while the tech itself uses P2P technology and is decentralized, the products we create are semi-centralized.
