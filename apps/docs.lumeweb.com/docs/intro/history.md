title: History

Lume started (before we even decided it was a project or the name) while we were trying to create a web3 cloud drive on Nextcloud based on Skynet. We realized that we were going down the wrong path and needed to solve accessing content before doing anything with the content itself.

Skynet in the process had a very rough year, as since 2020, Skynet tried to solve distribution with network of Skynet Portals, but experienced number of obstacles from all levels of internet infrastructure (see [Limitations of Web2](/problems/web2-limits.md)) and eventually was shut down.

Sia in the background was trying to support both innovating and Skynets efforts, and things came to a head with Skynet going bankrupt.

In that journey, Lume has pivoted at-least 1 time to meet its goals, and has ended up having to build many building blocks out of necessity, and a few that may go unused ðŸ™ƒ.

Sia has since started rebuilding with new software, and Lume has been building on top.

Sia is the network of the worlds data, and Handshake replaces ICANN while collaborating with the web3 ecosystem. We have discussed Sia a lot so far, but let it also be known the Handshake tribe has had its own share of drama too, and Lume is actively involved in both.

So the rabbit hole of Web3 DNS is where we started as the origin of Lume, which means the `world` or `light` in Romanian. It was our intention from the beginning to contribute to the solution of the web's censorship issues and becoming a bridge (or gateway) to the Web3.
