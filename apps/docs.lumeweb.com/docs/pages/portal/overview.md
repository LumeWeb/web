# Lume Portal Overview

The Lume Portal is your gateway to decentralized networks, making Web3 accessible without complex technical setup. It serves as a bridge between traditional web services and decentralized protocols.

## What is a Portal?

A portal acts as an access point and relay, allowing you to:
- Access content across decentralized networks
- Store and share your own content
- Interact with Web3 services seamlessly
- Maintain privacy and data ownership

## Our Portal Services

We provide two portal options with identical capabilities:

- **web3portal.com**
  - A public good funded by the Sia Foundation grant
  - Free access with fair use protections
  
- **pinner.xyz**
  - A paid community service (commercial)
  - Supports ongoing development

## Core Functionality

The portal provides:
- Multi-protocol support (currently IPFS, more coming)
- Content discovery and routing
- Data verification and integrity checks
- Privacy-preserving access methods

## Use Cases

Common ways to use the portal (some planned for future releases):
- Access decentralized websites and applications
- Share content peer-to-peer
- Social networking without centralized control
