# Storing Files

The Lume Portal provides access to decentralized storage through IPFS, with more protocols planned. Here's what you need to know about storing files through our services.

## Current Status

We offer two portal options:
- **web3portal.com** - A community portal funded by Sia Foundation grant (launching soon)
  - Free access with fair use limits
  - May prune inactive content/accounts to prevent abuse
  
- **pinner.xyz** - Our paid service portal
  - Same core functionality as web3portal.com
  - Supports ongoing development through user funding

Both portals offer:
- IPFS support (more protocols planned)
- API access
- File management tools
- Custom pin management
- Batch operations

The key difference is not in functionality, but in the funding model. web3portal.com is grant-funded as a public good with fair use limits, while pinner.xyz is a paid community service (commercial).

## How It Works

When storing files through a Lume Portal:

1. Files are encrypted client-side before upload
2. Data is distributed across decentralized networks (currently IPFS)
3. You receive a CID (Content Identifier) to access your files
4. Content Accessibility:
   - Files stored on IPFS can be accessed through any IPFS gateway or node
   - This means your content isn't locked to Lume's portals
   - You can use other IPFS-compatible services to access your files
   - The CID works as a universal reference across the IPFS network

This interoperability is a key feature of decentralized storage - your data isn't locked into our system. Whether you use web3portal.com, pinner.xyz, or another IPFS service, your content remains accessible as long as it's pinned somewhere on the network.

## Key Benefits

- **True ownership**: Your files are encrypted and only you control access
- **Censorship resistance**: No single point of failure for storage
- **Durability**: Data is redundantly stored across the network
- **Privacy**: End-to-end encryption keeps your data private
