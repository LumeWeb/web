# Getting Started with Lume

We believe in building practical solutions for a more open internet. That's why we're creating tools that bridge traditional and decentralized technologies.

## Who is Lume For?

We're focused on users who:
- Value privacy and digital freedom
- Want more control over their online experience
- Are interested in Web3 but need practical solutions, or just want better privacy and data ownership
- Believe in supporting sustainable, community-driven development

## What We Offer

Here's what we're building:
- A portal service that makes Web3 accessible today
- Privacy-respecting infrastructure that balances innovation with sustainability
- Tools that work within current systems while pushing toward decentralization
- Community-funded development of public goods technology

We're taking a balanced approach - building real Web3 infrastructure while ensuring our services are reliable and sustainable. This means some compromises today, but always with the goal of expanding digital freedom tomorrow.
